What is FT8-GO?
===============
FT8-GO creates a single-purpose laptop with optimized FT8 operation and helpful additions for portable amateur radio operations "in the field". 

It's perfect for re-purposing ancient laptops (up to about 12 years old!) You can use a laptop that's otherwise mostly unusable because of the processing demands of current operating systems and recent FT8 versions.

When you get ready to go to the "Great Outdoors" for FT8, leave your expensive new laptop at home... an old laptop does the job just fine.

Features:

- One-click upload to Logbook of the World (LOTW), one-click downloading current QSOs before operating.

- Easy 'Parks on the Air' (POTA) operation and one-click ADIF log generation, ready for upload using the POTA web site.

- Assisted 'Field Day' operation for a busy band, contacts are manually initiated.

- Convenient options for any type of FT8 activity, including selectable message sequences, responding to specific CQs (directed. local, DX).

- Never lose track of a QSO you start, never miss logging slow-responding stations... excellent for fast-paced crowded bands.

- Optionally, call stations again that you have already worked if they haven't QSL'd you at LotW within a month.

- Clear visual indications and audible alerts for all stations not worked yet, matching what you are looking for.

- Bandwidth-conserving "Listen" mode, on both transmit periods.

- Manual, semi-automatic, or full automatic QSOs, choose what suits you from minute to minute.

- You can grab any of several FT8-GO laptops before you head out for field operation: Take the one with the best battery charge, best USB ports, best screen, best wifi, etc. .... and have your current "worked-before" status downloaded immediately from LOTW with one click. Easy transition in just seconds to a spare laptop in case of hardware failure!
